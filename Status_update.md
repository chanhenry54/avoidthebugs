We have not yet fully implemented our minimal viable product as we still need to check for collision. Once we check for collision, our game is basically nearly done because after that, we just need to add a game-over screen.

As of right now, we are not facing any roadblocks. Everything is going smoothly as planned.

If there is extra time, we may need help implementing a scoreboard as it involves online API's to store and retrieve data.
