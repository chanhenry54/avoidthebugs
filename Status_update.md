We have not yet fully implemented our minimal viable product as we still need to check for whether the objects have collided with our main player. Once we check for collision, our game is basically nearly done because after that, we just need to add a game-over screen.

As of the moment, we are not facing any road blocks. Everything is going smoothly as planned.

However if there is extra time, we may need assistance in implementing a scoreboard as it involves online API's to store and retrieve data. This feature is not necessary but only adds to the game overall.
