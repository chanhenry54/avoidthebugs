# Avoid the Bugs!
Simple game based off of Google's dinosaur offline game. However instead of the dinosaur, we used one of our professor's face as the player and instead of the cacti, we used a computer bug as our obstacle.

Uses pygame to run and other standard libraries.


Made by Jeffrey Ha & Henry Chan for SPIS.
